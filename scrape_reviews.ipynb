The disappointment was not as big in Wynn Macau as in Wynn Palace, but I personally still find it hard to believe that this is a hotel awarded with five stars.  First of all, hardware. It is fair. Everything is clean and tidy, but that is it. My room was small, but the interior design could not use the tiny space meaningfully (on this point, Mandarin Oriental Macau is really superb). Therefore, the room gave a really scanty and plain feeling. Below-average interior design, so it is.

      "MGM Cotai has no obvious problem, but it does not have any significant strength either. Receptionists were polite, but everything was done within formality; the room was clean and tidy, but the interior design is nothing great. Not a comfortable room to stay in - something more like a Holiday Inn, which gets nothing to be criticized but is merely a room to sleep. The view is probably the worst bit. I booked a premier view room, but all I could see was Wynn Palace's building (not the lake, but just the building), the yet-opened Lisboeta, and a landfill site. Given how unpleasant the view from a premier view room was, it is hard to imagine what one can see from a standard room.  Also, the receptionists were very hard-sell for upselling their rooms. It was to the extent that the…\n",

The restaurant provides lots of Pops for us to decorate ourselves and made us into the atmosphere. Santa comes around to talk with the kids and gave them Xmas cookies that they treat as treasure.  Other then the feast, as a diner on that day, we can also join the complimentary activities such as decorating ginger bread and face painting.

Just then, it was my turn to check in and my 1 year old daughter didn't know what was going on and asked me to push her pram away. A hotel staff came out and give her an MGM lion, and she was very happy playing with it while I was checking in. Upon arriving in room, a cake was set up for our anniversary, and some snacks (gummy bears and marshmallows) were provided, together with some fruits. My son was overjoyed with the snacks.

      "MGM Cotai offered the best deal in town to attract local tourism, as far as I know they are the first to offer great room package with complimentary breakfast and 800mop dining credits, I've been staying in quite a few hotels in Macau and still think MGM Cotai offers the best deal. Room was upgraded with late check out, and the service associates have been extremely friendly. Hope to come visit again to try the pool as we couldn't due to thunderstorm warning. Thank you front desk and housekeeping for providing such a clean and comfy room to our stay!\n",

He has a very good sense of urgency. He offers whatever I need before I request. He understands the menu and the guests’ needs so well. It really goes above and beyond my expectation to a casual dining F&B outlet. Please pass on my thanks to him and I hope the management will be able to offer him some kind of accolade for his very outstanding performance and contribution to the restaurant.\n",

Second, we are also celebrating our wedding anniversary with my 2 year old daughter and that should be really fun for her.  It did took us some time to find the check in counter but the check in process was fine and smooth and the service agent also escorted us to our suite. When we opened the door, we saw this very spacious room(already very happy) and the children set up of candies and chocolates which seems very thoughtful. Then we go into the room and saw the balloons, pictures and the set up, we thought WOW, that is really really surprising.

The room, pool and  jacuzzi are excellent, but you shouldn’t miss the gym as well. Also I noticed the SPA looks good, though there wasn’t enough time for me to try. I will say the stay is definitely worth the price. Plus the warm welcome from all staff (no matter in hotel or restaurant), Mgm Cotai probably is the best choice for staycation in town : )\n",

Hardware and software in this hotel were excellent which made my stay memorable and delightful.   Its strategic location in Cotai area made hotels hopping convenient and accessible.   Food in the Cantonese restaurant Chun was delicious and service was impeccable.   MGM Cotai hugged their guests with TLC and thoughtful gestures, much impressed!

It was definitely the best birthday arrangement have experienced from a hotel. We entered the room with Happy Birthday balloons on the bed, a lego-made photo frame gift with our life photos inside (the hotel has asked me for photos in advance). And they also greeted us with a mini chocolate cake(yum!), a birthday card and fruits when we return from dinner. Hotel room itself is comfortable and spacious, breakfast buffet is awesome. The only problem is that the receptionist mentioned about the birthday surprise during check-in (out of our surprises), so ask your friend to stay away during check-in.

It was still acceptable until the moment we saw there was something not clean on the window. Let me say it more clearly, it’s not the dirt from the outside surface, but is something that the Housekeeping team can do better while cleaning. It was very gross to see that there were still human face oil and a dried noodle sticked on the window!   We called down to reception immediately and we got follow up by the Duty Manager. Her prompt action is appreciated. However, they really need to improve on the hygiene issue.\n",

From Chinese cuisine to Western cuisine, every restaurant has a unique design and the menu is well thought (including signature dishes of different provinces).  This visit came with a suprising dish called Impossible Meat Pot, which is made of broccolini, beetroot, quinoa, crispy potato cubes, fregola, and impossible meat.  Manager Eric is very helpful and knowledgeable.  He introduced the dish in details and my children enjoyed listening the story of Impossible.  The impossible dish is very creative.  Sauce, color, and choices of veggie are perfect.  This is not just an impossible meat pot.  This is indeed a melting pot of impossible imagination.   Love the dish and excellent service.

The hotel is easy reachable from the Taipa Ferry terminal via the complimentary shuttle bus service which also stops at Macau airport. Overall it takes about 10 minutes. The hotel is part of the Cotai strip and therefore a few miles away from the old town of Macau. This is again easy reachable via complimentary shuttle bus.  Check-in was quick and we were given a nice room on the 27th floor overlooking the Cotai strip. The room interior is fancy, new and very tasteful. Room size is also very decent. The room also featured a large bathroom including bathtub and shower. A good variety of different amenities are provided. Our room rate included breakfast at the Coast restaurant in the morning.

      "4 days in Macau for a conference. Newest of the MGM hotels, this is quite a way from Central Macau (and airport and ferry and bus!) but still quite easy with hotel shuttles.    The hotel itself is just like the Vegas ones. Big, a tasteless touch of glamour, 8 or 10 or 12 restaurants (can’t recall) and of course the casino. All around a cold feeling when going around the hotel.  Bedrooms are great (That is for sure!) with all the amenities that one would need to feel pampered and taken care off, whether for business, leisure or gambler. (Mini-bar on tap ! ) Distances between bedrooms and rest of hotel are fairly big... From 17th floor to the (closed) swimming pool was a good 5-6 mns walk ! And up and down...  Nothing special about this hotel...\n",

      "Recently, I had the experience of best hotel service at MGM Cotai.   My mum and dad were staying at MGM Cotai when a medical emergency happened to my dad.  Upon notification, the hotel staff reacted promptly to call the ambulance and render assistance.   While this might be the standard expected of such a hotel, what set it apart from the others was the level of care shown by the staff.   Having a medical emergency alone in a foreign land is a nightmare that every traveller dread.  When my mum was at a lost and the rest of the family was not with her, the senior management stayed with her throughout that day to accompany her, explained and guided her through the various procedures.   They were with her all the way into the wee hours of the morning until family members arrived…\n",

      "The MGM Cotai is just a blocks away from the main Cotai strip but its iconic shiny cubes block design will just attract you to visit once you seeing the building. The hotel also with nearly everything like restaurants, retail, casino, nice facilities, shows (irregular)..., that’s make it become nice location for a relax vacation. A bit pity is the retail area is quite small compare with other resorts complex at Cotai area.  My room is OK, clean and decent size, also they use the unique bright orange colour theme wall which hardly see on other hotel’s room. The other nice thing is my room view which I am able to see the performance lake of the Wynn Palace Cotai, this is cool to see the dancing water performance when I chill in the room.  The hotel with a lot of art pieces and…\n",

      "The hotel won't allow you to check in until 3 pm (pointless to ask if you want earlier), so when the time comes, everyone just flocks into the check in counter and the queue will be amazingly long. What's the point for such policy? When the room is ready partially, just let guest do the check in. I think this is a standard procedure in most 5 star hotels nowadays. Even a budget hotel allows you to do an early check in from time to time.   Avoid staying here unless you plan to stay after 4 or 5 pm. Things could be stressful due to a super long wait and you wouldn't want to be in that position. Disappointed!\n",
