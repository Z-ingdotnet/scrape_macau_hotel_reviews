The disappointment was not as big in Wynn Macau as in Wynn Palace, but I personally still find it hard to believe that this is a hotel awarded with five stars.  First of all, hardware. It is fair. Everything is clean and tidy, but that is it. My room was small, but the interior design could not use the tiny space meaningfully (on this point, Mandarin Oriental Macau is really superb). Therefore, the room gave a really scanty and plain feeling. Below-average interior design, so it is.

      "MGM Cotai has no obvious problem, but it does not have any significant strength either. Receptionists were polite, but everything was done within formality; the room was clean and tidy, but the interior design is nothing great. Not a comfortable room to stay in - something more like a Holiday Inn, which gets nothing to be criticized but is merely a room to sleep. The view is probably the worst bit. I booked a premier view room, but all I could see was Wynn Palace's building (not the lake, but just the building), the yet-opened Lisboeta, and a landfill site. Given how unpleasant the view from a premier view room was, it is hard to imagine what one can see from a standard room.  Also, the receptionists were very hard-sell for upselling their rooms. It was to the extent that the…\n",

The restaurant provides lots of Pops for us to decorate ourselves and made us into the atmosphere. Santa comes around to talk with the kids and gave them Xmas cookies that they treat as treasure.  Other then the feast, as a diner on that day, we can also join the complimentary activities such as decorating ginger bread and face painting.

However, don't go to MGM Cotai if you want to have any fun at the pool, it is absolutely NOT ALLOWED.

Front office staff greeted us and have us sat first so that we didn’t need to queue up for check-in. It just took a few minutes to wait. The Front Office agent explained the package and location and operation time of pool in detail (my apology I forgot his name...start with A- or E-). The manager Joseph is very nice and friendly. The staff at Pool Reception is very professional and energetic. The room service hotline staff and call center staff are professional as well. They all made us felt we were warmly welcomed.

To top it off, there was a greeting card with a hand-drawn picture of Mickey and Minnie - how sweet! The room was luxurious and huge. We really felt spoiled by the team at MGM Cotai.

The view from the room is spectacular, overlooking the airport and the cable car ( of a hotel across the road).  The room is very spacious, making our stay here a very memorable one.  The staffs at the front desk and reception area are very friendly and helpful. The hotel interior is well designed making visitor feel they are exposed to a relaxing environment. Surely we will stay again at MGM Cotai again if we come to Macau again.\n",

      "Booked MGM Cotai for my boyfriend's birthday last week, and have let the hotel know that we would like some arrangements for that. It was definitely the best birthday arrangement have experienced from a hotel. We entered the room with Happy Birthday balloons on the bed, a lego-made photo frame gift with our life photos inside (the hotel has asked me for photos in advance). And they also greeted us with a mini chocolate cake(yum!), a birthday card and fruits when we return from dinner. Hotel room itself is comfortable and spacious, breakfast buffet is awesome. The only problem is that the receptionist mentioned about the birthday surprise during check-in (out of our surprises), so ask your friend to stay away during check-in. Would definitely recommend whoever would like to…\n",

      "Stayed with my family during CNY. The room size is comparatively smaller than the other hotels in Cotai.   It was still acceptable until the moment we saw there was something not clean on the window. Let me say it more clearly, it’s not the dirt from the outside surface, but is something that the Housekeeping team can do better while cleaning. It was very gross to see that there were still human face oil and a dried noodle sticked on the window!   We called down to reception immediately and we got follow up by the Duty Manager. Her prompt action is appreciated. However, they really need to improve on the hygiene issue.\n",

From Chinese cuisine to Western cuisine, every restaurant has a unique design and the menu is well thought (including signature dishes of different provinces).  This visit came with a suprising dish called Impossible Meat Pot, which is made of broccolini, beetroot, quinoa, crispy potato cubes, fregola, and impossible meat.  Manager Eric is very helpful and knowledgeable.  He introduced the dish in details and my children enjoyed listening the story of Impossible.  The impossible dish is very creative.  Sauce, color, and choices of veggie are perfect.  This is not just an impossible meat pot.  This is indeed a melting pot of impossible imagination.   Love the dish and excellent service.

      "We stayed one night at the MGM Cotai during our trip to Macau. The hotel is easy reachable from the Taipa Ferry terminal via the complimentary shuttle bus service which also stops at Macau airport. Overall it takes about 10 minutes. The hotel is part of the Cotai strip and therefore a few miles away from the old town of Macau. This is again easy reachable via complimentary shuttle bus.  Check-in was quick and we were given a nice room on the 27th floor overlooking the Cotai strip. The room interior is fancy, new and very tasteful. Room size is also very decent. The room also featured a large bathroom including bathtub and shower. A good variety of different amenities are provided. Our room rate included breakfast at the Coast restaurant in the morning.

      "4 days in Macau for a conference. Newest of the MGM hotels, this is quite a way from Central Macau (and airport and ferry and bus!) but still quite easy with hotel shuttles.    The hotel itself is just like the Vegas ones. Big, a tasteless touch of glamour, 8 or 10 or 12 restaurants (can’t recall) and of course the casino. All around a cold feeling when going around the hotel.  Bedrooms are great (That is for sure!) with all the amenities that one would need to feel pampered and taken care off, whether for business, leisure or gambler. (Mini-bar on tap ! ) Distances between bedrooms and rest of hotel are fairly big... From 17th floor to the (closed) swimming pool was a good 5-6 mns walk ! And up and down...  Nothing special about this hotel...\n",

Thanks MGM for the arrangements this time. We will definitely recommend this hotel to others and looking forward to come and visit again in the future. By the way, the restaurant Aji and Grill 58 are pretty good, worth to give them a try. 👍 My hubby likes Aji especially the 4-selection Sushi, and I personally love the lobster in Grill 58.\n",

      "I celebrated the anniversary with my boyfriend, and they provided a very good hospitality to us. During check-in, the front desk staff gave me a lion doll and offered me other special amenities like little cake and card for our celebration. Meanwhile, the room is very spacious and clean. All of MGM staff was very nice to us too. We will suggest MGM cotai to our friend when they visit macau next time and sure, we will be back absolutely!\n",

      "The hotel won't allow you to check in until 3 pm (pointless to ask if you want earlier), so when the time comes, everyone just flocks into the check in counter and the queue will be amazingly long. What's the point for such policy? When the room is ready partially, just let guest do the check in. I think this is a standard procedure in most 5 star hotels nowadays. Even a budget hotel allows you to do an early check in from time to time.   Avoid staying here unless you plan to stay after 4 or 5 pm. Things could be stressful due to a super long wait and you wouldn't want to be in that position. Disappointed!\n",
